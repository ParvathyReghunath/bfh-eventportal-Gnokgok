# Project name
# bfh-eventportal-Gnokgok
This is a project to build up event portal site for our college. In this website we have created a homepage where the user can register and login. Home page also contains the events that are already updated.On clicking Register button will redirect the page to registration form where user can provide necessary details like first name ,last name, username,email id,password etc.On clicking the submit button this page is redirected to login page where user could login using username and password.This is again redirected to user profile page where all the events are listed one by one.Clicking the register button corresponding to each event will display a message saying registration is successfull.User can register for multiple events as per their wish.They could also logout from their page after registering.
The template used in our website makes it look more awesome.Our website is userfriendly such that every user can access it .Since we have created a website there is no need to download an app for accessing it. By creating a password for each user our website ensures completely secure environment. Moreover user gets notification via email after registration and few days prior to registerd event.
